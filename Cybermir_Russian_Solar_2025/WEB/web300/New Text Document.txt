Web 300
Our 'cutting-edge' login system was written by JSOC interns who swear it`s unbreakable.

We suggest you take a closer look!

You have full access to the source code of the app and can run it locally.

Your task is to find the vulnerabilities, exploit them as a chain, and submit their CWE codes in the flag format below.

No flag is hidden in the code or UI.

The only correct submission is your vulnerability analysis.

Flag format: solar{CWE-XX,CWE-YY}

Please submit both CWE codes in the order you exploit them.
