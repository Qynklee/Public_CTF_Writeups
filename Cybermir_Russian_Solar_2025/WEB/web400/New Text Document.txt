Your friend asked you to register for a super cool event and sent you a link.

You notice a suspicious registration form.

Can you spot whatâ€™s wrong with it?

You have full access to the source code of the app and can run it locally.

Your task is to find the vulnerabilities, exploit them as a chain, and submit their CWE codes in the flag format below.
